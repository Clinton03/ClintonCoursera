                <h2>Monster</h2>
                <p>
                    When I was young I never thought about my neck. It was smooth and supple like the rest of me. Now my neck is a monster. A saggy, craggy, battle damaged monster. If I pinch the skin on my neck, it stays pinched, like silly putty.Recently I was in Target shopping for shirts. I tried one on and looked in the mirror. The image reflected back was terrifying. A dark throat cavern nestled between two angry tendons. Something you might see in a horror movie close-up. The throat of an old man who should not have answered the door
